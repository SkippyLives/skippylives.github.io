Day 1 of the new site.

Its kinda empty... Need to find some plants.

Working on tearing down the old sites. It is kinda sad. The sports forum had been running since the late 90s. Backing it all up and will save it to disk somewhere. Maybe will try to extract it into something someday.

Been playing with [Unity3d]( https://unity3d.com ) - they have some really nice tutorials on their website.
