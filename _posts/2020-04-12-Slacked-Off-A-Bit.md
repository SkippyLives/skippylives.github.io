These last two weeks was kind of a break from everything. I spent most evenings playing games (Satisfactory) with some friends. We started fresh with their new update III. It has some really cool additions and changes to the way some things worked. So far it has been a lot of fun as well as a time sink. But sometimes we need to take a break and recharge some. 

It also means I need to get back on track on some things as well as there are a couple new goals I am looking to add to my list. So this week I will probably continue to play games and relax I am also going to be updating my planner and mapping some new things. 

Work on the RPG is still moving forward. Though the break to play games has slowed down some of the writing down of things. I have been churning the leveling process and balance in my head. Sometimes it is good to step back for a bit to get a better picture.
