So what a week huh? I had already been working from home since our company was really supportive of it. I am surprised at how fast it went from nah its just the flu to everything is closed. I am glad they went this route. I didn't expect them to get this far until after it was farther along.  

For me the transition hasn't been too bad. I switched from working out at the gym to working out at home. Running is easy as I have a treadmill as well as I can just run outside if its nice. The other days are a little harder as I don't have a gym full of equipment but I have enough for now. My wife did after school care so she is done for awhile. Which is fine I would rather her not work until things are under control. 

This last week I spent most of my free time cleaning the basement and getting rid of a lot of old stuff that has been piling up. There is a local place that recycles electronics on the second Saturday of the month so dropped off a car full of broken computers and other electronics. Rearranged some things so the treadmill takes up less room and got rid of some shelves. I still have one more shelf to figure out and then I will have plenty of room to work out. 

I also worked on getting the framework of the RPG website going. I am using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org) which is a [Clojure](https://clojure.org) program to make a static web site from CSS, templates and data files. Which means I had to figure out how it all worked and relearn some CSS. Overall it wasn't so bad and I have something to work off of now. 

Plans for the coming week include getting closer to finishing up the initial RPG spec so that I can play test more. I didn't get much done this last week on it just stuff in my head. I also need to work more on the basement and figure out what to do with some of the extra stuff. I also am doing some O'reilly learning things. Stretch goal would be to get [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) up and running to monitor a couple [Docker](http://www.docker.com) containers I am running to see what it looks like. 

I have found that having a good daily routine has made it a lot easier these last couple weeks. Getting a daily workout in, eating healthy (avoiding the comfort snacks that are high in sodium and saturated fat), an afternoon break (a walk or just do something else to get away from the computer a bit), and limit the amount of time watching/reading the news. My son will start remote classes next week so we will see how that adjustment goes but will do as much as I can to help him get used to it. 

Stay Safe. Make good choices for yourself and those around you.
