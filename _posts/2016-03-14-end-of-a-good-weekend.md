Learned a ton this weekend getting this site built and everything migrated over. I also completed 2 Unity tutorials. 

Roll a ball which I want at some point to make work on mobile. I think moving the ball around that way would be interesting to program. 

2D Roguelike which is a survival game. You eat food and just try to go as many days (levels) as you can. The enemy AI is super basic but its a tutorial. would like to make better pathing for it or something like it. 

I also decided to try my first non tutorial app with unity. I made a random team generator for Foosball. Ya. I know. but it was a fun exercise in the UI components in Unity3d. I have it so yo can use it through the web (HTML5) or on Android (apk). So I can have on my phone. 

In addition get my Github repos set up and have some of the code there now too.
