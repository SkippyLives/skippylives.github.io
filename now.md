What is a now page? It is kind of a list of my current goals, what I am focused on, and where I am at. A better description probably is at [nownownow.com][now] though.

For me it is the things I am doing (or should be doing) all in one place.  More for me to see and be able to keep focused on the things that matter. But isn't really a task list as I don't really check them off as "complete".  At least not how I am doing it anyways. Though I imagine some things will just evolve into other things.
